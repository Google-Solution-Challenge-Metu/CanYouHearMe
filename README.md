# CanYouHearMe

This app is a mobile application designed to help individuals and communities respond to natural disasters in a more organized and efficient manner. The app features five main components: account creation and information sharing, volunteer work, donation system, mapping function, and a watch version of the app with additional features.
# The Sustainable Development Goals
 The Sustainable Development Goals, also known as the Global Goals, are a set of 17 goals established by the United Nations in 2015 to promote sustainable development worldwide. These goals cover a range of topics including poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, renewable energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and climate action. Google has committed to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals by leveraging its technology, expertise, and resources to create positive impact around the world. Google works with partners across sectors to address these challenges and create scalable solutions that can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

# Our Goal
Our app aligns with Goal 11 of the SDGs, which aims to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Specifically, we aim to contribute to Target 11.5, which seeks to reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters. This target includes two sub-targets: 
* 11.5.1, which focuses on reducing the number of deaths and injuries caused by natural disasters
* 11.5.2, which aims to mitigate economic losses resulting from natural disasters. 

# The Meaning Of Our Logo
Our team was deeply moved by the heartbreaking photo of the father holding his deceased daughter's hand under the rubble after the recent earthquake in Turkey. It served as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of natural disasters and the importance of taking steps to mitigate their effects. As a tribute to those affected by the earthquake, we chose to incorporate the image of a hand holding in our app logo. Our hope is that it will serve as a reminder of the importance of disaster preparedness and the need for greater efforts to promote safety and resilience in the face of natural disasters.

# Technolgies Used
* Flutter for cross-platform development of the user interface
* Firebase for backend development, including the Firestore database for storing user and location data
* Tensorflow and Tensorflow Lite for building and implementing artificial intelligence features
* Google Maps API for location data

# Features
* **Account Creation and Information Sharing:** Users can create an account and share crucial information, such as the location of a missing person, with the wider community. This facilitates the dissemination of vital information and supports organized rescue and recovery efforts.

* **Volunteer Work:** The app provides a platform for individuals to locate nearby opportunities for volunteer work. By enabling users to easily identify and participate in local volunteer work, the app encourages community involvement in disaster response efforts.
* **Donation System:** The app features a donation system that facilitates monetary donations and blood donations to organizations supporting earthquake relief efforts. The AI system is designed to avoid issues observed in previous disaster relief efforts where donated items were not useful, such as the inclusion of cocktail dresses or high heels.
* **Mapping Function:** The app includes a mapping function that allows users to identify buildings that have collapsed during the earthquake. By providing this information, the app supports the safety of individuals and emergency responders by indicating areas that should be avoided.
* **Watch Version of the App:** As part of our app's efforts to reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters, including the recent earthquake, we plan to incorporate a watch version of the app with additional features. This watch version will include an SOS button that can be used by individuals who may be trapped under debris after an earthquake.
